# Design Patterns
The goal of this project is to showcase implementations of some of the most commonly used design patterns in Java.

**The following patterns will be addressed:**

## Creational
- Singleton
- Builder

## Structural
- Adapter
- Decorator
- Facade

## Behavior
- Observer
- Strategy

# Definition

## Summary
There are 3 categories of design patterns:

1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavior

Below these categories, there are more than 23 design patterns, nonetheless, in this project, only the 7 most used will be covered.

Singleton
> The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it, restricting instantiation and offering controlled access to a single object.

Builder
> The Builder pattern, separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing you to create different representations of the object using the same construction process.

Adapter
> The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to collaborate by converting the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect.

Decorator
> The Decorator pattern allows you to add new behaviors or responsibilities to objects dynamically, without altering their existing code, by wrapping them in special "decorator" objects.

Facade
> The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use by clients. It acts as a single point of access, hiding the complications of the underlying system.

Observer
> The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, allowing one object (the subject) to notify multiple other objects (observers) about changes in its state, triggering automatic updates.

Strategy
> The Strategy pattern is defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
